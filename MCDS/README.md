# MCDS database samples
Here we provide two "databases" created using CELL for tests with protons with energy between 0.5 to 500 MeV. This databases can be used directly with the output of a FLUKA simulation to speed up the cell survival calculations.
Each database contains the energy, LET and yield of DSBs produced per cell and per track. All of this information was obtained using MCDS.
For more information [Check the documentation of CELL](https://mpvalen.github.io/interfaz_grafica_adn.html).

 - ``p-20-samples``: contains a single database for protons with 20 different energies.
 - ``p-50-samples``: 20 databases for protons, each one has data using 50 different energies.
