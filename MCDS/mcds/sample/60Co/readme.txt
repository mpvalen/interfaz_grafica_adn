Secondary electron energy spectra for 60Co generated using the PENELOPE
Monte Carlo code [Co60(hsaio).dat], as described in 

Y Hsiao and  R.D. Stewart, Monte Carlo Simulation of DNA Damage Induction 
by X-rays and Selected Radioisotopes. Phys. Med. Biol. 53, 233-244 (2008).

 
Also included in this folder is a 60Co secondary electron
spectrum [Co60(park).dat] calculated using MCNP.
